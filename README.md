## A massive Celeste mod using Everest - designed for custom maps and custom mechanics

This has been a labor of love for me for a number of years now, starting back when I felt comfortable enough to code after a long hiatus, to being one of the most robust helpers for Celeste modding as a whole.

To use this helper: Download the reference files uploaded to Gamebanana [here](https://gamebanana.com/mods/53700)

As time goes on, this will be updated to support Loenn and have its own Wiki within Github for mini-tutorials for how to use these mechanics in your maps, and how they work at a high level.
