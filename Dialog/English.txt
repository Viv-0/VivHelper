modoptions_VivHelperModule_FollowerDist=Modify Player-Follower Distance

modoptions_VivHelperModule_FollowerDist2= Set Distance Between Followers
modoptions_VivHelperModule_FollowerDist2_sub=Changes the distance between two Follower objects.{n}(such as Strawberries, Keys, or the Carryable Torch) (Default: 5)

modoptions_VivHelper_RCSBW= RCS Black & White
modoptions_VivHelper_RCSBW_sub= Changes the Refill Cancel Spaces a pure white texture, which is useful for{n}readability with colorblindness. Recommended to be used with{n}RefillCancelSpace Lines.
modoptions_VivHelper_RCSL=RefillCancelSpace Lines
modoptions_VivHelper_RCSL_sub=Creates lines instead of particles which show the rough direction of{n}travel for each line. Useful for reading what RefillCancelSpaces do what.

# NOTES:
# The # Symbol at the start of a line counts as a Comment. To include in dialog, use a \#
# The . Symbol will cause a pause unless escaped with \. (ex: Mr. Oshiro has a pause, Mr\. Oshiro does not)
# Newlines automatically create a Page Break, unless there is an {n} command on the previous line
# Commands: Anything inside of curly braces {...} is a command and should not be translated.

# Inline Text Commands:
# {~}wavy text{/~}
# {!}impact text{/!}
# {>> x}changes speed at which characters are displayed{>>}
# {# 000000}this text is black{#} (uses HEX color values)
# {+MENU_BEGIN} inserts the dialog from the MENU_BEGIN value (in English, "CLIMB")
# {n} creates a newline, without a page break
# {0.5} creates a 0.5 second pause
# {big}this text is large{/big}

# Gameplay Control Commands (should never change)
# {trigger x} this triggers an in-game event
# {anchor} controls the visual position of the textbox in-game

Extra Information

Viv_VivHelper_tp1_1=
This is an Instant Teleport Trigger\.
You might ask "Why can't I see it?," and that's because it's a trigger\. You can't see triggers\.
What does it do? It instantly (or not instantly if you choose) teleports the player to any point in any room in the map\.
Because we can't see it, I'll be using Lightbeams to represent where a Teleport Trigger is from this point on\.

Viv_VivHelper_tp1_2=
This is the teleporter functioning properly. With this Teleport Trigger, currently, every time you teleport, the room you are in is reset, as if you had just transitioned to a new room\.
The teleport trigger works by sending the player to the proper X and Y Coordinate in the room specified. If that point isnt in the room, or the room doesn't exist, expect weird things to happen\.
The simplest way to move the player to where you want, currently, is to just add a random trigger in the room you want to teleport to, and copy the X and Y coordinates of that point\.
Place those coordinates into New Position X and New Position Y, & the room name into Warp Room\.

Viv_VivHelper_tp1_3=
A common issue people have is that it appears to go offcourse by some small distance\.
To fix this, it's 9 times out of 10 going to be turning off "Add Trigger Offset\."
The attribute just makes it so that the teleporting location is dependent on the position of the player relative to the top left of the trigger\.
This would be used in a number of cases, mainly if the player can dynamically move around in a space with a teleporter\.
An example is shown here\.

Viv_VivHelper_tp1_4=
The "Transition Type" is what the screen shows when a player Teleports\.
There are options of Lightning Strike, a White Flash, the Glitch Effect, or nothing at all\.
Examples of these three are above\.

Viv_VivHelper_tp2_1=
The Different Teleport Triggers add more and more functionality\.
The Basic Teleport Trigger only works with the player's position\.
The Advanced Teleport Trigger adds a function to change the player's velocity upon exiting the teleporter\.
The Fully Custom Teleport Trigger adds onto the Advanced Teleport Trigger by allowing a rotation of the player's motion\.
The latter two makes it much more mechanical, and can be used with gameplay\.


Viv_VivHelper_Curve=
Introduction
Explanation
Curved Entities

Viv_VivHelper_Curve_Intro_1=
This... is a curve\.
Curves are usable in a lot of cases. The easiest one to explain is actually not exactly a curve though.
The first use of "curved entities" is really making two lines with different speeds, at the same time.
This can produce a way more custom Easing system (which is only furthered by the Easing options already given.
If you want mathy answers to how fast your stuff will move, I can't advise actually doing it. (But I am working on a Desmos graph to show it)
Just see the examples below.

Viv_VivHelper_Curve_Intro_2=
Alrighty, now for the real deal\. Curves are curvy lines\. Now, what does that mean?
If you're math-inclined, like I am, I'll be happy to tell you there's much more info in the Extra_Notes\.txt file in the zipped folder, you don't have to unzip it to read it\.
But for the folx that aren't, here's the basic premise\. A {#ff8888}Simple{#} Curve is definable by three points\.
Fortunately, I don't need to give a visual as if you use Ahorn you will be able to see the exact curvature of the Simple Curve\.
A Cubic Curve is definable by 4 points\. This gives a new line structure with much more options to produce a curve from, albeit harder to wrap your head around\.
These curves can be used for basically everything (within some level of reason, and also not boosters for a little while yet, for logistical reasons\.){0.4}:(
Not everything has been fully implemented, however\. Currently, only Zip Movers and Platforms have been implemented\. Swap Blocks and Camera Triggers are coming soon\.
